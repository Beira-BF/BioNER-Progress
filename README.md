# BioNER Progress #
## Introduction ##
**Named entity recognition (NER)** is the problem of finding references to entities (mentions) in natural language text, and labeling them with their location and type. In biomeidcal domain, **biomedical NER (BioNER)** focus on the biomedical entities like gene, protein, chemical, disease, mutation, etc.
